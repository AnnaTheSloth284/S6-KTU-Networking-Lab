SOCKET
One endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on network
It provides bi-directional FIFO communication facility over the network.
A socket connecting to the network is created at each end of the communication.
Each socket has a specific address which is a combination of an IP address and port number
Generally employed in client server applications
The servers create a socket attaches it to a network port address and then waits for the client to contact it. The client creates a socket and then the transfer of data takes place.
There are different types of sockets available like Datagram Socket and Stream Sockets. They vary in the transport layer protocol that they use
